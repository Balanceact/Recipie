        <h1>Swedish meatballs</h1>
        <p>Swedish meatballs, or köttbullar, must be prepared, above all, with love. This is why homemade meatballs are
            a widespread concept in Sweden, and there are many different favourite recipes - with and without meat. Some
            people feel there should be grated onion in the meatball mixture itself, while others prefer to dice the
            onion and fry it separately. Some people feel that their meatballs should be served with thick brown gravy,
            while others prefer it with a thin meat juice.<br>
            <br>
            As part of a smorgasbord buffet, it is better to skip the gravy altogether.<br>
            <br>
            Traditionally, in southern Sweden many people prefer their ground meat with a little more fat, and the
            further north you go, the less pork you will find in the meatball mixture. However, bread or rusk crumbs
            allowed to swell in milk are as important as the lingonberries - and the optional pressed cucumber - on the
            side. The breadcrumbs give Swedish meatballs their special soft consistency.<br>
