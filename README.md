# My favorite recipe

_( Or any recipe )_

In this task, you will create a simple website without any direct styling _(apart from the browser's default styling)_ about a recipe that you like. It can be your own parade dish or some dish that your mother used to cook for you when you were little.

Before you start building your website, you must do the following:
Create a new repo on your github with a _READEME.md_ included.
Clone the repo to your computer _(or fork this)_ and start building your website in that repo, and don't forget to make small commits and pushes in the meantime.

When you create the recipe, it is important that the recipe is easy to follow and that the website is built with semantic elements to the highest degree possible.

### Requirements

- A header tag that contains a title in the form of an h-tag as an introductory description of the recipe and perhaps why you have chosen this particular recipe.

- At least two images must be included, and both must contain the _alt_ attribute. How you choose to place the images and for what purpose is up to you to decide. But some kind of cover image can be good in any case. You can google the images.

- A clear section where you list the ingredients in a "bullet list". Elements that must be used _( but not limited to )_: section, ul and li.

- A clear section where you list the instructions for the recipe. Elements that must be used _( but not limited to )_: section, ol and li.

- A footer tag where you list some contact information for yourself _( may be made up information )_. Maybe there's a restaurant or pastry shop out there that wants to hire you because your recipe looks so yummy!

- CSS! _( Wait for this one until after CSS round )_ Styling is important and should be included, and it should be proper. Tip is to style your recipe page according to your recipe, i.e. use as a theme that the dish goes in, colors and so on.
